## How does it work?
The goal of this repos is to make development on Cardano more accessible.
Start by cloning the repo and experimenting with the network emulator.
First question to ask self is "Do I understand how eUTXO model works?" 
If not, please refer to Documentation section.

Experiment with transaction inputs, find conditions that cause "transaction rejected" error.
