Big Thanks to Done Collectively, Stellar, Helios, Gimbalabs and James D., Romain Soulat IOG. 

## Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

## How does it work?
Start by cloning the repo and experimenting with the network emulator.

Experiment with transaction inputs, find conditions that cause "transaction rejected" error.

Experiment with the validator logic, e.g. https://github.com/aleeusgr/sniffle

To build your dApp gather product requirements and user stories, create Issues - formulate testable expectations and make tests pass.
