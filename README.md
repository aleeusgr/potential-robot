This tool is a hammer: as all things simple it is rather versatile.
It's main goal is to give a startup founder a toy to play around with and build a prototype until they can scale it enough to hire a consultancy to set up a certified stack. It could be thought of as [demeter.run](demeter.run) that does not require internet connection.

Big Thanks to Done Collectively, Stellar, Helios, Gimbalabs and James D., Romain Soulat IOG. 

## Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

## How does it work?
It makes experimentation simpler and it connects you to the community,

Start by cloning the repo and experimenting with the network emulator.
First question to ask self is "Do I understand how eUTXO model works?"
What changes would cause "transaction rejected" error?
If you have difficulties building tests from requirements, experiment with [helios-examples](https://github.com/lley154/helios-examples) and [plutus-use-cases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-use-cases) to improve your intuitions about smart contracts on Cardano.
If you find yourself pondering "what the requirements would be?" the best way to go is to present your idea at Gimabalabs Playground.
If you wish to see how to integrate Helios with NextJS, see this [example](https://github.com/lley154/helios-examples/tree/main/vesting)
