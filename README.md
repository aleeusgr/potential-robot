# nin 
nin is used to architect a COSP project using only TypeScript. 

It was conceived as an alternative to plutus-starter /add link/ to follow along documentation on the doc page /add link/ which is plain simple to run.

What are: 
- tradeoffs
- differences


Using automated testing is a requirement in the Common Criteria EAL4(review level) and Cardano Certification Standard L1 (review level).

## Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

## How does it work?
It makes experimentation simpler and it connects you to the community,

Start by cloning the repo and experimenting with the network emulator.
First question to ask self is "Do I understand how eUTXO model works?"
What changes would cause "transaction rejected" error?
If you have difficulties building tests from requirements, experiment with [helios-examples](https://github.com/lley154/helios-examples) and [plutus-use-cases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-use-cases) to improve your intuitions about smart contracts on Cardano.
If you find yourself pondering "what the requirements would be?" the best way to go is to present your idea at Gimabalabs Playground.
If you wish to see how to integrate Helios with NextJS, see this [example](https://github.com/lley154/helios-examples/tree/main/vesting)
