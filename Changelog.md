The goals starts to be more clear. 
I need to run unit tests on desirables. 

- [ ] psm
- [ ] helios

then an integration test:

- [ ] psm + helios.

This will allow me to generate and test new logic.
Once I have the logic that I need, I need to search for bugs. 
No-code first: use text and graphical descriptions to have a contract model easily accessible.
How do I go on from the model to actual test code?

Enhancements: 
- [ ] running CI in the cloud would work around my poor hardware. Tradeoffs?
